## Usage 

Using prompts upon clicking the "Generate Password" button the user will select the length (between 8 and 128) and if the user would like to use numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, or any combination of those four options. The generator spits out a random password and you are free to click the button to generate another. The generator clears the displayed value so that there is no need to refresh the page in order to run the password generator again.
